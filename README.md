# what is EntityManager ?

Interface used to interact with the persistence context.
The EntityManager API is used to create and remove persistent entity instances, to find entities by their primary key, and to query over entities.
The set of entities that can be managed by a given EntityManager instance is defined by a persistence unit. A persistence unit defines the set of all classes that are related or grouped by the application, and which must be colocated in their mapping to a single database.
